Question 1:
	Nothing needs to be done as this permission is stored in the eflags register
	which is automatically saved and restored on context switch. It is therefore
	unnessary to do anything more.

Challenge:
	I implemented ctrl-c to kill running environment. Specifically, in the shell,
	you can hit ctrl-c when a environment is running and that will terminate the
	currently running program. This allows exiting a misbehaving program or exiting
	from a REPL environment, like when running num.

	To implement this, I created a new wait function that either waits for program
	termination or exits upon CTRL-C. Note that console.c uses a special bit modifier
	on the key to signal CTRL.

	I created a new system call sys_ccheckc which allows checking if a character is in
	the keyboard buffer without advancing the pointer for the read pointer in the circular
	buffer. See the output below:

		paras@ubuntu:~/code/cs3210-lab$ make run-icode
		...
		init: running sh
		init: starting sh
		$ ls
		newmotd
		motd
		lorem
		script
		testshell.key
		testshell.sh
		init
		cat

		CTRL-C interrupt
		$ num
		    1 test1
		    2 test2
		    3 test3
		    4 test4
		CTRL-C interrupt
		$

	As I extended the kernel to support checking for characters in the keyboard buffer,
	this kept the user-land code minimal.

	Care had to be given to ensure that A) the control-c key was not sent to the shell upon
	exiting the program, B) the new system call would not introduce some vulnerability and
	C) that capturing the CTRL-C signal would not prevent programs from capturing normal
	input. A potential security drawback from this approach is that a malicious user program
	could query for all alphanumeric keys with the goal of trying to extract a password that
	a user was entering for another user environment. A fix for this may be to restrict the
	system call to only checking for various types of signals (e.g. CTRL-C, CTRL-Z, etc).
